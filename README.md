# üï∑Ô∏è Wikiscraper

Simple web scraping done in Python using the **requests** library to send a GET request to the Wikipedia URL where I performed the scraping, and **Beautiful Soup** for selecting and formatting the HTML of two paragraphs from the following article:

> Project Status: ‚úîÔ∏è (completed)

https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python

The paragraphs present:
* What the Python language is;
* The origin of the Python language name.

Wikiscraper creates a .txt file as soon as it is executed, displaying the two paragraphs formatted with utf-8 standard and two functions with regex for better readability.
